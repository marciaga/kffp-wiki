# Station Rules

## Safety & Security

* Do not let anyone you don't know into the Baker building or the station. If they need to be there, they will have the code.

* Be careful entering and leaving the station at night.

* If you observe anything suspicious, email programming@freeformportland.org and volunteer@freeformportland.com

## Food and drink

* NO FOOD OR DRINK IN THE STUDIO.

* No alcohol in the station at all.

* Nonalcoholic food and drink is OK in the station outside of the studio.

* No smoking or vaping in the station.

* It is illegal to do your show intoxicated.

* What to do if the FCC shows up
If the FCC shows up, let them in and follow their instructions.
On the studio door are phone numbers to call when the FCC shows up, make these calls immediately.
There is a binder in the studio, and a link on the station computer with directions for turning off the transmitter, should the FCC ask for this.
Don't leave the studio unattended
Get contact info for DJs before and after you.
Show up at least 15 minutes early, don't freak out the previous DJ!
If the next DJ doesn't show, contact them first. If unable to reach them, contact the DJ after, and find out if they can come in early
Email programming@freeformportland.org and let them know about the noshow.
Grab music from the library to play if you don't have more of your own stuff.
You will get double volunteer hours for staying and filling in for the noshow, as will the next DJ if they arrive early.
It is illegal to leave the transmitter unattended.
How to Find a Sub
Before emailing the entire DJ & Sub google group, consider asking friends at the station, or sending emails to other DJs in similar time slots or genres!
If all else fails, email the DJ list: freeformcurrentdjsubdjlist@googlegroups.com
Once you have a trained KFFP DJ or Sub committed to cover your slot, get their phone number.
Send an email to subs@freeformportland.org, and the DJs before and after your show, with the following information:
The name and contact info for your sub. They must be someone from the attached list!
Your name, show name, and time slot.
On the Air
Legal Station ID
At the top of every hour, there must be a legal station ID.
"KFFP-LP 90.3 FM, Portland Oregon" is the legal station ID.
Any other time during the hour, say "Freeform Portland 90.3 FM and freeformportland.org." You not need to do the entire station ID.
Backrap
Always announce the music you played in reverse order (backwards from most recent to the start of the set.)
Say the artist, song title, and album title. Feel free to add any other information, such as year of release, record label, anecdotes, etc.
A set should be 20-25 minutes or 5 songs max. Any more and your audience won't remember what they heard!
Acknowledge the Other DJs
Thank the DJ before you and announce the DJ after you.
It is both polite, and helps listeners understand sometimes jarring music changes.
Payola & Plugola
Freeform DJs should refrain from any on-air activity that could be construed as Payola or Plugola.
Payola is when a broadcast station is paid to broadcast station or employee thereof is paid for airing program material. Any such sponsored material must be explicitly identified as paid for and by whom at the time of broadcast.
Plugola is on-air promotion of any non-broadcast activities of the station licensee or on-air personality that could result in financial gain. Plugola examples:
Promoting your own DJ gig for which you are being paid.
Promoting concerts and other events in exchange for gifts such as concert tickets or drinks.
Safe Harbor/Indecent vs. Obscene
Indecent material, while protected by the first amendment, can be regulated by the FCC. Broadcast indecency is language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the
broadcast medium, sexual or excretory organs or activities, that does not rise to the level of obscenity.
Obscene material is not protected by the first amendment. Material is considered obscene when the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, finds that the material:
appeals to prurient interests,
depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way,
and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
NEVER play obscene material.
Do not broadcast indecent material between 6 AM and 10 PM. Between 10 PM and 6 AM, indecent material may be played with a safe harbor announcement, which is posted on the wall by the control board.
DJs and their guests must not swear on-air or say anything deemed indecent, even if it's the name of a band. This includes the words sh*t, p*ss, f*ck, c*nt, c*cks*ck*r, m*th*rf*ck*r, t*ts, *ssh*le, p*ssy, d*ck, or any slang terms used to degrade a person based on their race, gender identity, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status or sexual orientation.
While there is a dump button, it should only be used in emergencies. Do not intentionally play indecent material outside of safe harbor hours, or obscene material at any time.
Public complaints need not be received for a DJ to be held in violation of these station policies, which could result in the loss of your show.
